## About the Project  
This is a **Multifunctional Speech and Text Application** built using Streamlit. It combines several powerful features like:
- Converting Speech to Text
- Generating Speech from Text
- Translating Text between languages  

This tool is perfect for language learning, accessibility, or just having fun experimenting with text and speech conversions!

## Features  
1. **Speech-to-Text**:
   - Upload an audio file (`.wav`, `.mp3`, `.ogg`) and convert it into text using `SpeechRecognition`.
  
2. **Text-to-Speech**:
   - Enter text and convert it to speech using `gTTS` (Google Text-to-Speech). Supports multiple languages.

3. **Text Translation**:
   - Translate input text into another language using `deep-translator`. Supports translation to/from English, French, Spanish, Hindi, and German.
